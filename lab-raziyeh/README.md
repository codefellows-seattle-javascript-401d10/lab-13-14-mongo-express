## Running

- In your root server, type in the command **"npm start"** in your terminal.

- GET request:  
    ```http localhost:3000/api/order?id=selectedId ```
    ```http localhost:3000/api/customer?id=selectedId ```

- POST request: 
    - create a order or cusromer and save in mongo db

- PUT request: 
    - update a specific order 

- DELETE request: 
   - remove a specific order and also remove the order_id from the customer model ( from orders array)

## Testing: 
we have two models ( customer and order) , so we have tests for both models:

-  Tests:
    - test to ensure that  API returns a status code of 404 for routes that have not been registered
    - tests to ensure that **/api/person** endpoint responds as described for each condition below:
        - GET - test 404, responds with 'not found' for valid request made with an id that was not found
        - GET - test 400, responds with 'bad request' if no id was provided in the request
        - GET - test 200, response body like {<data>} for a request made with a valid id
        - POST - test 400, responds with 'bad request' for if no body provided or invalid body
        - POST - test 200, response body like {<data>} for a post request with a valid body
        - PUT - test 200, response body like {<data>} for a post request with a valid body
        - DELETE - test 204
